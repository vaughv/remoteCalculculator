# Java RMI-Based Calculator with GUI

This is a simple distributed calculator application built using **Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation)**. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) and features a **Java Swing GUI** on the client side. All operations are processed remotely by the server.

| `Server.java`         | RMI server that binds the implementation to the RMI registry.              |
| `Client.java`         | RMI client that connects to the server and invokes remote methods.         |
| `ClientGUI.java`      | Swing-based GUI that interacts with the RMI client.                        |
